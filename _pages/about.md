Bo Wang is currently a assistant professor at Zhengzhou University. He received his Ph.D degree in Computer Science from Hunan University in 2025 and has been a visiting student at Nanyang Technological University from 2024 to 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Chee Keong KWOH.

## RESEARCH FOCUS

Advanced deep learning technologies have enabled the characterization of tissue complexity and provided biological insights into spatial organization within tissues. My research is focused on developing deep learning models to analyze spatial transcriptomics data. 
Specifically, my research interests include:

**1. Deep Learning**

Graph Learning for biological application
  
Self-supervised learning
  
Contrastive Learning
  
**2. Single-cell Omics and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis**
   
Spatial clustering
  
Cell type deconvolution
  
Spatial multi-omics integration
